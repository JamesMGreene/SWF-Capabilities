# SWF-Capabilities

## Description

SWF Capabilities can grab the user's Flash "system capabilities" object, which holds
certain system information that can be used as an aid in things like spam
control, user authorization, short-term user validation, etc. Referrer and IP
can be spoofed, but the system capabilities object cannot.

This repo's gh-pages site will _just_ display the values of these capabilities.  

See your browser's Flash capabilities:  http://jamesmgreene.github.io/SWF-Capabilities/index.html  
See the raw JSON version:  http://jamesmgreene.github.io/SWF-Capabilities/index.json.html

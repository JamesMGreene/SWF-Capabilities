# SWF-Capabilities

## Description

SWF Capabilities can grab the user's "system capabilities" object, which holds
certain system information that can be used as an aid in things like spam
control, user authorization, short-term user validation, etc. Referrer and IP
can be spoofed, but the system capabilities object cannot.

This repo's gh-pages site will _just_ display the values of these capabilities.
